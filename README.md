This project aims to create a reusable example application which generates valid NFTs and automatizes important steps in order to lower the usability hurdles and improve crucial adoption. As an open source project, the result can be used by others, also for small to medium sized companies, to easily create NFT solutions for their own marketing strategies, sales management or online campaigns for several non- or commercial purposes. A private secondary market mechanism can be supported for a deeper relationship of customers to the owning seller. In particular, we are creating a web service that can be used to buy and trade NFTs of Nürnberg and Riga on the Ethereum Kovan Testnet.
