## Testing & Deploying with Remix

[Testing with Remix](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CYdOn0eiUXAyF83s0Fz78pUXdbAVu6cv977ivMEDXYU/edit?usp=sharing)

* If both contracts are deployed, first:
* 1. Copy Address of TokenFactory
* 2. in NftTheWorld: execute function setFactoryInterface() with just copied address
* 3. Copy Address of NftTheWorld
* 4. in TokenFactory execute function addtoAdminContracts() with just copied address
* Optional: In NftTheWorld: with addtoAdmins() add your teammates to contract, so they are elligible to test as well
* Feel free to Test!


## Verifying & Publishing 
* 1. After deploying contract(s) go to https://kovan.etherscan.io/ and look for contract address
* 2. Hit tab "Contract" mid-page and just below click "Verify & Publish"
* 3. Select: Solidity (Single file), Compiler Version v0.8.0 & respective license type & continue
* 4. In next step, copy & paste contract & source code, and eventual Constructor Arguments & other setting (not needed atm)
* 5. Hopefully find successfully generated ByteCode on next page



## Folder structure

* contracts/: Directory for Solidity contracts
* migrations/: Directory for scriptable deployment files
* test/: Directory for test files for testing your application and contracts

## Files 

* truffle-config.js: Truffle configuration file for setting network information and other project-related settings.

* contracts/Migrations.sol: Manages and updates the status of the deployed smart contract. This file comes with every Truffle project, and is **usually not edited**.

* contracts/TokenFactory.sol: Needs to be deployed first, and address of smart contract copied

* contracts/MainContract.sol: Holds the main functionality, needs to be deployed 2nd, than function setFactoryInterface() with just-copied address as parameter

* migrations/1_initial_migration.js: Migration (deployment) script for the Migrations contract found in the Migrations.sol file.

* migrations/2_hello_world.js: Migration script for the HelloWorld contract. (Migration scripts are run in order, so the file beginning with 2 will be run after the file beginning with 1.)
